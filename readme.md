Getting Started:

1. Upon pressing play, a random maqam(scale) will be generated and played. 

2. The user must then choose the correct name of the scale that was just played.

3. If the player guesses, the number of attempts is increased by one.

4. If the player guesses correctly, the score is increased by one.


5. The player can replay the sound of scale without generating a new random scale
